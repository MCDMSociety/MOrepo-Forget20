	abstract     = {The recent success of bi-objective Branch-and-Bound (B&B) algorithms heavily relies on the efficientcomputation of upper and lower bound sets. Besides the classical dominance test, bound sets areused to improve the computational time by imposing inequalities derived from (partial) dominancein the objective space. This process is called objective branching since it is mostly applied whengenerating child nodes. In this paper, we extend the concept of objective branching to tri-objectivecombinatorial optimization problems. Several difficulties arise in this case, as there is no longer alexicographic order among nondominated outcome vectors in the multi-objective case, with more thantwo objectives. We discuss the general concept of objective branching in any number of dimensions andsuggest a merging operation of local upper bounds to avoid the generation of redundant subproblems.Numerical experiments on tri-objective knapsack, assignment and facility location problems show asignificant speed-up in the B&B framework.}
