# Tri-objective combinatorial optimization problems

The paper consider instances for tri-objective combinatorial (binary variables) optimization problems. 
Problem classes considered are Knapsack (KP), Assignment (AP), Facility Location (FLP) and IP/MILP (general problems with a mixture of constraints)


## Test instances

Instances are named `Forget20_[problem class]_n<n>.raw` where `n` is the size of the problem. The paper considers
instances of size 5-50; however, the instance set also contains 5 instances of size 60-100. Costs
are generated random in [0,30].

All instance files are given in raw format. 


### Raw format description 

All problems are given in a matrix format ...
